header: Concurrency &amp; Performance in Ruby
---

We all know Ruby can "scale" and that it's usually Fast Enough&trade; but it doesn't have the best reputation with regards to high throughput or high performance computing. Is this true?

## No

This site is here for the Ruby community to document &amp; share ideas around better ways to write *and* implement Ruby so the statement above will one day be something we can all look back at and laugh.

The sections in the header are just ideas right now. This is a new project, and it is meant to be tailored to what the community wants. Please submit [issues](https://github.com/ruby-io/ruby-io.github.com/issues) or [fork away](https://github.com/ruby-io/ruby-io.github.com) &amp; add content. All help is appreciated!

We have a mailing list now rubyio@librelist.org and we're on freenode: #rubyio.
